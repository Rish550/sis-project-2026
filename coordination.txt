Miguel said we should do it about a knock-off cola and Rishab said we should do it about computers, I said we should do it about Rings. We came to the conclusion to let a Randomizer on Google decide what we take and we got Rings. 
We decided that I will do the description of Rings and Rishab and Miguel both do one Argument paragraph for the website and I choose that, so I told everyone who does what.
